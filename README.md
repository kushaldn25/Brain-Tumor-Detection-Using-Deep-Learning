# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

# Objective:

The objectives of the process of detection of Brain Tumor using MR image analysis are broadly divided. Study of pre-processing of MR images. Image acquisition Adaptive filtering Study of Image Analysis of MR images Segmentation Feature Extraction Enhancement Development of neural network algorithm for Classification and Detection of Brain Tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging method is widely used for detecting the model of the tumor developed in human brains. Manual detection of tumors is very difficult. Manual process which is carried out is also susceptible to failure in critical preoperative situations and causes overall increased operating time and healthcare costs .When faced with a patient with brain tumor surgeons have to change the modular components and the liner, that is why it is crucial to know the tumor model before the surgery starts to avoid any kind of operativeÂ failures.
